ü§ñ AI-Powered Health Risk Profiler
====================================
üìú1.Overview
--------------------------
This project is an intelligent data-processing engine built to transform raw health survey data into actionable insights. It features a versatile dual-input system, capable of ingesting survey information from either image files‚Äîprocessed through an integrated OCR pipeline‚Äîor directly via a JSON payload.

Once the data is structured, the service leverages the Google Gemini AI in a sophisticated, multi-stage analytical process. This workflow goes beyond a single query, executing a chain of tasks:

It first identifies key lifestyle risk factors from the raw text.

Next, it classifies the overall risk with a numerical score and rationale.

Finally, it generates personalized, actionable recommendations to address the identified risks.

The entire process is wrapped in a robust REST API using Node.js and Express, delivering a predictable and comprehensive JSON report ideal for integration into any web or mobile frontend.

üèóÔ∏è2.Project Architecture & Flow
 -----------------------------------
The application is built on a modular architecture that separates concerns for clarity and maintainability. The following diagrams illustrate the project's data flow and code structure.

üöÄ3.Setup and Installation
----------------------------------------
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16+ recommended)

NPM (included with Node.js)

A Google Gemini API Key

Step-by-Step Setup
Clone the Repository:

git clone <[https://github.com/Likhith0123/Health-Risk-Profiler.git](https://github.com/Likhith0123/Health-Risk-Profiler.git)>
cd Problem-6


Install Dependencies:
Run this command to install all necessary libraries from package.json:

npm install

Configure Environment Variables:

In the root of the project, create a new file named .env.

Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio.

Add the key to your .env file:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your_personal_api_key_here

üèÉ4.How to Run the Application
------------
To start the API server, run the following command from the project's root directory:

 node server.js

The server will start and listen for requests on 

http://localhost:3000

 üìö5.API Reference
------------------
This section provides a detailed reference for using the API.

Endpoint: POST /analyze
This single endpoint processes all survey data.

Option A: Analyze an Image
Use this method to send an image file for OCR and analysis.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:3000/analyze

Body: form-data

Key: surveyImage

Type: File

Value: Select your survey image file.

Example curl command:

curl -X POST -F "surveyImage=@OCR_PROCESSING/sample_image.png" http://localhost:3000/analyze

Option B: Analyze Raw JSON Data
Use this method to send survey data directly as a JSON object, bypassing the OCR step.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:3000/analyze

Headers: Content-Type: application/json


Body: raw (JSON)

{
  "age": 58,
  "smoker": false,
  "exercise": "I walk for 30 minutes most mornings",
  "diet": "My diet is balanced but I have a sweet tooth",
  "alcohol": "A glass of wine a couple times a week",
  "sleep": "I usually get about 6 hours of sleep"
}

Example curl command:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"age": 58, "smoker": false, "exercise": "I walk daily"}' http://localhost:3000/analyze

‚úÖSuccess Response (  200 OK )
----------------------
A successful analysis returns a JSON object with the full report.

üß†6.AI Prompt
------------------
The core of the analysis is controlled by the system prompts sent to the Google Gemini API.
Certainly. Here is a revised breakdown of the prompts, explaining what each one does and how it aligns with the specific functions and required JSON schemas in your geminiAPI.js code.

## Prompt 1: Get Risk Factors
Purpose: This initial prompt takes the raw survey data (e.g., "exercise": "I walk sometimes") and summarizes it into a list of clear, professional phrases.

Used in Function: identifyRiskFactors(surveyData)

**Required JSON Output:**
{
  "risk_factors": ["string", "string", ...]
}

Prompt Text:

You are a health data summarizer. For each lifestyle habit provided, identify the key factor and describe it in a clear, professional phrase (e.g., 'High sugar intake', 'Lack of physical activity'). You must summarize every category provided. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with a single key, 'risk_factors', which is a list of these summary strings.

## Prompt 2: Risk Classification
Purpose: This prompt analyzes the list of risk factors generated by the first step to calculate a numerical score and determine an overall risk category.

Used in Function: classifyOverallRisk(riskFactors)

**Required JSON Output:**
{
  "risk_level": "string",
  "score": "number",
  "rationale": ["string", ...]
}

Prompt Text:

You are a health risk classification engine. Your task is to analyze a list of lifestyle factors. Based on these factors, you must calculate a numerical score between 0 and 95, determine an overall risk_level ('low', 'medium', 'high'), and provide a rationale (a list of the primary factors). Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the keys risk_level, score, and rationale.

## Prompt 3: Get Recommendations
Purpose: This final prompt uses the list of risk factors to generate a full report that includes personalized, actionable advice for the user.

Used in Function: generatePersonalizedRecommendations(riskFactors)

**Required JSON Output:**
{
  "risk_level": "string",
  "factors": ["string", ...],
  "recommendations": ["string", ...],
  "status": "string"
}

Prompt Text:

You are an expert health analyst. Your task is to analyze a user's survey responses. Based on the data, you must determine an overall risk_level, list the key factors, provide a simple recommendation for each factor, and set a status field to 'ok'. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the keys risk_level, factors, recommendations, and status.

Of course. Here is a file tree structure that accurately represents your final project, formatted in a similar style.
